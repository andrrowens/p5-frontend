# Getting Started With Rooted Plant Exchange (Frontend)

Rooted Plant Exchange was created to allow gardeners, growers, and green thumbs to connect with the plant-loving community and to allow users to trade and give away plants to others in their area. It also provides educational information through the Plant Library and User Submitted Plants section.

The following steps are to set up and get started with the frontend of the project.

## Git Clone:

To start you'll need to have Mac vers or WSL2 set up.

Go to the following URL: https://github.com/andrrowens/p5-frontend

Next, click on Fork button at the top right of your screen.

Next, click on the green <>Code button. A dropdown should appear. 

Make sure to select Local and SSH as shown in the image below and then click the button with two overlapping boxes located in the center-right of the screen. This will copy the SSH key for you.

Next, open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to clone Rooted Plant Exchange.

Then type: 

> git clone

Then paste the copied SSH key from GitHub by right clicking or pressing command + v (Mac users) or ctrl + v (Windows users).

Once the SSH key is pasted press enter.

Then type:

> ls

Find the file "p5-frontend"

Then navigate into the project directory typing:

> cd phase5-frontend


Then type:

> code .

This will open up the project repository in VSCode.


You'll need to install the dependency (library) for our front-end React application inside of a terminal that's opened within VSCode.

To do this type:

 > npm install

 This step may take up to a few minutes.

 Once that's complete, type:

 > npm start

After running npm start the homepage should open up in your browser!

From the homepage, you will need to sign up in order to fully access Rooted Plant Exchange:
